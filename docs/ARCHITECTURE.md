# Architecture

## Shape

Three apps on one API and one PostgreSQL database.

```
apps/web (Next.js + Ant Design 6)   apps/mobile (Expo / React Native)
             \                              /
              \---- apps/api (NestJS) ------/
                         |
                    PostgreSQL (Prisma)
                         |
                  local disk uploads (/uploads) -> S3/R2 later
```

`packages/shared` holds the enums, display labels, role permission helpers and the TypeScript
shapes of every API response, so web, mobile and API agree on one contract.

## Multi-tenancy

- Every tenant-scoped table has `organizationId`. All queries filter by the caller's organisation,
  taken from the JWT, never from the request body.
- Users belong to exactly one organisation today, but membership is a normal foreign key so it can
  become a join table without a data migration of the business tables.
- Roles are rows per organisation (`Role.key` is a system key such as `PROJECT_MANAGER`). Each new
  organisation is seeded with the default role set; later, tenants can rename or add roles without
  code changes. Permissions derive from the key in `packages/shared/src/permissions.ts`.
- Postgres row-level security is the planned second line of defence once there is a second tenant.
- Not built yet, on purpose: self-signup, subscriptions, plan limits, branding.

## Access model

- Company-wide roles (Admin, Management, Procurement, Accounts, HR) see all projects.
- Everyone else sees projects they manage or are a member of (`ProjectMember`).
- Approvers are Admin, Management and Project Manager, limited to projects they can see.
- A submitter cannot approve their own entry unless they also hold an approver role.
- `ProjectAccessService` is the single place that encodes these rules; every service calls it.

## One approval workflow

`SubmissionLifecycleService` owns the state machine used by progress entries, DPRs and material
requests:

```
DRAFT / CHANGES_REQUESTED --submit--> SUBMITTED --review--> APPROVED | REJECTED | CHANGES_REQUESTED
```

Every transition writes an `AuditLog` row (who, what, when, note). Adding a new submission type
(attendance, machinery log, expense, measurement) means adding a table with the same six status
columns and registering it in the lifecycle service; the approvals queue and audit trail come free.

## Planning and progress

- `BoqItem` carries the contract quantity and rate. `Activity` is the unit of site reporting and
  optionally links to a BOQ item.
- `ProgressEntry` records executed quantity against an activity. Only APPROVED entries count.
- BOQ executed quantity = sum of approved progress on its linked activities.
- Physical progress % of a project = activity completion weighted by BOQ value (rate × planned
  quantity), falling back to planned quantity when an activity has no BOQ link.
- Project-type differences (chainage for roads, floors for buildings, connections for water) are
  carried by free-text `location` and the activity list, not by schema. A per-type activity template
  is the planned next step so new projects start from a standard list.

## Money and quantities

Decimal columns everywhere (`Decimal(18,2)` for money, `Decimal(18,3)` for quantities) and strings
over the wire. No floating point for contract values.

## Attachments

Uploaded first (`POST /api/uploads`), then linked to the entry by id. This keeps mobile forms simple
and lets a photo be taken before the form is finished. Local disk now, object storage later; only
`storagePath` changes.

## Offline (planned)

Not in the MVP. The API already accepts client-supplied dates and idempotent creates are a small
change (client-generated ids), so the mobile app can add a local queue later without API redesign.
